At the same time, librarians are stewards of knowledge, and digital libraries offer archives a way to share their collections with a broader audience. This panel addresses the conflicts and opportunities between climate issues and digital archives, including maintaining industry standards, such as those from the NDSA, that encourage multiple geographically distributed copies. This workshop will provide participants with an introduction to the scope of library data usage and offer case studies on how librarians and data managers are changing their approaches.",

Launched in 2021, with the generous support of the Mellon Foundation, the program has awarded approximately $4 million to archives, historical societies, libraries, museums, and other collecting organizations to deepen public understanding of the histories of people of color and other communities and populations whose work, experiences, and perspectives have been insufficiently recognized or unattended. The program builds upon the foundation of the previous iteration, Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives, which awarded $20,000,000 in digitization grants from 2016 to 2020.\n\nLinks\nAbout Digitizing Hidden Collections: Amplifying Unheard Voices: https://www.clir.org/hiddencollections/\nAbout the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR): https://www.clir.org",
