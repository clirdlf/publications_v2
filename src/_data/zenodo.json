    "description": "<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Emulation&ndash;the use of modern computer systems to run historical software&ndash;is a growing practice within libraries, archives, museums, and galleries that is essential to conserving and providing ongoing access to the digital past. Emulation makes it possible to interact with historical data and digital artifacts in ways that are more consistent with their creators&rsquo; intentions, helping contemporary users better understand how and why those artifacts were made. Increasingly, academic and cultural organizations face challenging decisions about using emulation to preserve and provide access to their collections.&nbsp;<em>An Overview of Emulation as a Preservation Method</em> introduces fundamental concepts related to emulation in practice and explains key considerations that can inform these decisions. The report also includes a review of academic literature related to emulation and suggests new avenues for potential future collaboration and exploration. Together, the conceptual overview, example use cases, and literature review provide readers new to emulation with an orientation to the current state of practice as well as an understanding of the important role of emulation in the larger field of digital preservation.</p>\n<p>The six authors of the report are members of the <a href=\"https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/\">Software Preservation Network</a>&nbsp;(SPN)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/working-group/tech-infrastructure-working-group/\">Technological Infrastructure Working Group</a>. Over several years, this group has been documenting and sharing insights about emulation workflows actively employed in academic and cultural settings. Their work aims to establish best practices and inform scalable infrastructure solutions that can be broadly shared so that legacy software can become more accessible and maintainable in the future.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

    "published": "2024-09-04",
    "description": "<p>This study explores the relationship between humans and seeds, from the first agricultural societies 12,000 years ago to the modern era of centralized agribusiness corporations. Authors Jennifer K. Embree and Neyda V. Gilman argue that seeds, like any resource, have been a tool for human power, control, and development. As genetic biodiversity in plant life collapses due to climate change, Embree and Gilman offer seed libraries as a community-centered service that libraries can provide to combat food insecurity while celebrating biodiversity. Both faculty-ranked academic librarians at Binghamton University, the authors were inspired to write this publication as they worked together to launch their library&rsquo;s Sustainability Hub in 2021, which includes the campus&rsquo;s first seed library.</p>",

Contributors explore how complicity with carceral systems and the Prison Industrial Complex undermines equitable access to information and perpetuates systemic harms. Drawing from their experiences working with collections documenting the lives and creativity of incarcerated individuals, the authors reflect on how traditional archival methods often fall short of providing respectful access to these materials. The volume offers a call to action for reimagining archival work grounded in abolitionist values.</p>",

    "description": "<p>My 2003 CLIR report addressed the questions that the digital revolution raises at a time when use of the Internet was surging. My subsequent work as an editor of RILM (R&eacute;pertoire Internationale de Litt&eacute;rature Musicale), a global online music bibliography that covers all fields of music, has been a journey through the far-reaching changes that globalization and digitalization have imposed on academic research in the last twenty years. RILM was conceived in 1966 as a global research tool modeled after the UNESCO idea, and its wide scope was ahead of its time. How has this model fared in the era of digital globalization?</p>",

    "description": "<p>Over the past five years I have had the opportunity to advise dozens of short archival research projects using the collection of the Musiksammlung at the &Ouml;sterreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna, Austria, the primary archive where I completed my CLIR Mellon Fellowship. Despite the prevalence of freely available digital archival materials, when confronted with original sources such as manuscripts in a well-known composer&rsquo;s hand, medieval sacred chant books, or annotations filling the margins of &eacute;tude books, students have expressed excitement and engagement that goes far beyond anything that occurs in a traditional classroom, or while examining digital documents.</p>\n<p>In this essay I offer some suggestions on working with college students on archival projects, as well as speculations on the benefits of encouraging active use of physical archives by modern students. Students who live vast portions of their lives online can benefit as much as, if not more than, earlier generations by studying physical archival documents. Encounters with original sources can increase comprehension, excitement, and creativity for students longing for educational experiences that create a feeling of authenticity. &nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>Most scholars can point to a paper they never intended to write&ndash;one that resulted from a serendipitous &ldquo;find&rdquo; in an archive during research for something else entirely.&nbsp; This is one of the most fruitful and fun aspects of archival research: the unexpected avenues pursued only because we stumbled upon interesting material in an adjacent shelf mark or because a skilled archivist pointed us toward a dusty box we&rsquo;d never have found on our own. Much of this serendipity is lost as we conduct more and more of our research online using digitized source databases.&nbsp; In this paper, I will explore ways of achieving serendipity in virtual primary source research when in-person research is impossible, whether due to funding constraints or the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This paper is a response to discussions of digitization at meetings of the National Humanities Alliance (NHA). NHA asked the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) to evaluate the experiences of cultural institutions with digitization projects to date and to summarize what has been learned about the advantages and disadvantages of digitizing culturally significant materials. Findings revealed that digitization often raises expectations of benefits, cost reductions, and efficiencies that can be illusory and, if not viewed realistically, have the potential to put at risk the collections and services libraries have provided for decades. One such false expectation--that digital conversion has already or will shortly replace microfilming as the preferred medium for preservation reformatting--could result in irreversible losses of information. This paper defines digital information; identifies weaknesses of digitization as a preservation treatment; discusses the benefits and drawbacks of digital technology for access; and highlights issues institutions must consider in contemplating a digital conversion project.</p>",

The study analyzes from the perspective of libraries the strategies, visions, and products that vendors of integrated library systems are offering as solutions. Case studies are provided of four different types of libraries that have installed commercially available systems to provide a snapshot of the extent to which these systems met the needs of the institutions. Vendor profiles are then offered for 12 companies, including a brief summary for each, and information on primary products and services, primary markets, overall strategy, product tools and features, adaptability to library needs, strategy for networked information, product development infrastructure, acquisitions and strategic partnerships, corporate organization and offices, and a financial statement.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This report contains a survey undertaken in 2003 by CLIR to study the state of audio recordings in academic libraries. One purpose of the survey was to inform decision makers in those libraries, as well as in funding agencies, about the scale and extent of barriers to preservation and access. Another purpose was to elicit information that would help the participating libraries assess their own readiness to preserve and provide access to their recorded-sound collections. We also hoped that survey findings would help library leaders and funders determine how best to allocate preservation funds and thereby help ensure access to historically important sound recordings. Finally, the survey was designed to raise awareness within the larger research and funding communities of the value of audio collections and to encourage institutions with important audio holdings to seek support for their collections.</p>",

    "published": "2009-09-01",
    "description": "<p>Prepared by the Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property Washington College of Law, American University Under the supervision of Peter Jaszi with the assistance of Nick Lewis.</p>\n\n<p>This is the third of three studies of copyright and sound recordings commissioned by the National Recording Preservation Board (NRPB) in support of the congressionally mandated study of the state of audio preservation in the United States. All three studies have focused on how laws pertaining to sound recordings made before 1972 affect preservation of and access to audio recordings. As readers of the previous two studies know, sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, do not benefit from federal copyright protection. In the absence of a national law, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, individual states passed anti-piracy and other laws to protect producers of sound recordings from unauthorized duplication and sale of recordings.</p>\n\n<p>In this study, Professor Peter Jaszi and students in the Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property at American University&rsquo;s Washington College of Law examine criminal and civil laws of 10 states, as well as judicial decisions and common law, pertaining to sound recordings fixed before 1972. The authors provide a brief history of the formulation of these laws and examine the laws and court cases that may determine the extent to which nonprofit institutions may preserve and disseminate pre-1972 recordings.</p>",

The symposium provided a forum for stakeholders from institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean to share strategies for digital archiving and cultural preservation and to identify common areas of need.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the symposium was for the stakeholders to formulate a set of questions for funders, libraries, archives, and others based in the United States, Canada, and European nations to consider when evaluating grant proposals for digital projects, or when considering post-custodial archival work with institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. The authors sought to develop recommendations and equitable practices to enhance cultural engagement through collection development that fully acknowledges Latin American and Caribbean organizations as equal partners with a voice in decision making for projects and grant funding.</p>",

    "published": "2022-03-01",
    "description": "<p>This study explores the common barriers and shared visions for creating access to archival collections held by libraries at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). One of few reports that document the needs of HBCU libraries as they relate to archives and special collections, it is based on a series of online focus groups that author Sharon Ferguson Freeman facilitated with HBCU library directors and deans in 2021. The study provides insight into the significance of special and archival collections for HBCU librar&shy;ies and their communities; the management and capacity of archives and special collections; and these libraries&rsquo; values, priorities, needs, and aspirations. The findings also reveal information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HBCUs and broader topics of significance that were not anticipated when the project began.</p>\n\n<p>In parallel with Freeman&rsquo;s research, Portia D. Hopkins and Synatra A. Smith conducted a series of interviews with staff working at five HBCUs, investigating their libraries&rsquo; unique priorities, resources, and work processes. Smith and Hopkins prepared an internal report with a detailed set of strategic and technical recommendations for the HBCU Library Alliance. An executive summary of their findings is appended to the report and available separately as a downloadable PDF.</p>\n\n<p>This two-part study grew out of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clir.org/2019/07/clir-and-hbcu-library-alliance-form-national-partnership/\">partnership</a>&nbsp;formalized in 2019 between the HBCU Library Alliance and CLIR, and a 2020 Mellon Foundation grant for a study to inform a sustainable shared infrastructure for creating access to HBCU Library Alliance members&rsquo; archival collections.</p>",

These Arctic and Subarctic regions are on the front lines of the climate crisis, making the urgent documentation and preservation of their histories, traditions, and ecological knowledge vital before they are lost or altered forever. Remotely Useful addresses the unique challenges faced by Northern communities in safeguarding their documentary heritage. As these records are intricately tied to their identity, history, and traditions, their preservation becomes crucial for maintaining continuity and promoting a sense of pride and belonging among community members.</p>",

    "published": "2023-08-01",
    "description": "<p>Between 2019 and 2022, Liz Bishoff of The Bishoff Group and Thomas F. R. Clareson, senior consultant for Lyrasis, conducted a series of in-depth interviews, surveys, and focus groups with participants in CLIR&#39;s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, focusing specifically on the fellowships in data curation for the humanities created with the support of the Mellon Foundation. Over a span of four years, the team interviewed approximately 70 current and former fellows, supervisors, and program leaders, examining the value the fellows&#39; work has held for scholarship and library practice.<br>\n<br>\nAn emerging area when the data curation fellowships were first introduced to the program in 2012 and 2013, data and--later--software curation have expanded as areas of focus within the program and within the library and archival professions. The fellows&rsquo; roles also changed significantly both before and during the COVID-19 global pandemic, and the report documents how this evolution affected their experiences, host organizations, and CLIR&rsquo;s program.</p>\n\n<p>The report encapsulates the team&rsquo;s methodologies and presents a compilation of their findings. The evaluation not only considers the impact of CLIR&rsquo;s fellowship program, but also opens up new horizons for organizations aspiring to create dynamic short-term project-based employment opportunities within academic and cultural heritage spheres while nurturing new talent.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In this collection of short essays, former recipients of the CLIR Mellon Fellowships for Dissertation Research in Original Sources reflect on the diversity of their experience. From 2002 and 2019, more than 250 student-scholars received support from the program to conduct archival research around the world. Former fellows reunited for a symposium in 2022 to offer perspectives on the future of scholarly work with original sources. Seven of the fellows worked to refine and contextualize contributions to the event&rsquo;s program for a wider audience. Presented in five chapters, the collection explores the diversity of approaches to archival research in the humanities and humanistic social sciences; the potential narratives that original sources can support; how archives can enhance undergraduate teaching; current challenges and threats facing researchers working with archives; and the uncertain prospects for future archival research.</p>",

As the world moves toward a future that looks increasingly uncertain, frightening, and chaotic because of the impacts of climate change, preservation of the historical record is essential both for continuity of cultural memory and civil society, and for documentation of the ongoing permanent alteration of natural and human environments. A Green New Deal for Archives tackles the pressing challenges faced by archives globally, including the immediate and long-term risks associated with climate change and inadequate staffing. Drawing inspiration from the U.S. New Deal of the Great Depression era, author Eira Tansey proposes a public policy program that intertwines both challenges and offers a blueprint for their resolution.</p>",

University research libraries that have begun to create digital collections have encountered some common problems surrounding metadata and encoding for digitized versions of primary source material, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>inadequacy of traditional descriptive metadata schemes for describing digital objects;</li>\n\t<li>the absence of standards for administrative metadata; and</li>\n\t<li>the need for a flexible mechanism to express structural metadata regarding digitized</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>versions of a wide range of materials in different formats (text, image, audio, video, etc.). The Making of America II project (MOA2), sponsored in part by the Digital Library Federation, attempted to address some of these issues, and created an XML DTD based on the research the project participants had done on descriptive, administrative and structural metadata schemes. This XML format provided a single document type that could encode descriptive, administrative and structural metadata for a wide range of materials. However, it was intentionally restricted to textual and image materials, and so does not adequately support the needs of those trying to create digital libraries of audio-visual materials. A variety of other shortcomings of the DTD have also been identified by those trying to employ the DTD. This workshop was intended to try to examine the use of MOA2 to date and see if a successor format could be created which would rectify the MOA2 DTD&rsquo;s shortcomings.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The AIC is led by the Digital Library Federation (DLF) with support from the College Art Association (CAA). Funded to July 2000 by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the DLF, and with contributions from Yale and Carnegie Mellon Universities, the AIC is presently developing a prototype. The prototype is envisaged as a working system exemplifying what may be achieved in a networked environment by and for the visual arts community. It is a collection of images and a set of tools that may be implemented, configured, and extended locally to meet institutional needs. It is designed according to open source principles and in compliance with industry- wide standards and best practices. As importantly, during the prototype&rsquo;s development, the AIC will investigate organizational, legal, and business issues and produce a set of recommendations about how best to secure the development of what we hope may emerge as a vital community resource.</p>\n\n<p>The prototype&rsquo;s development is a collaborative effort that draws upon the expertise of art historians, visual resource specialists, leading computer technologists, and business and legal advisors. Its presentation to interested communities in venues such as the CAA Annual Meeting and the Art Libraries Society of North American Conference affords a crucial opportunity to solicit feedback from potential users and contributors&mdash; feedback that may be incorporated into its further development.</p>",

The revision sought to expand the reach and appeal of the program to a broader range of institutions, including independent and community organizations, and to emphasize the digitization of historical materials that tell the stories of groups underrepresented in the digital historical record. Significant changes were made to the application structure, new applicant support resources were created, eligibility was expanded to Canada, and new thematic emphases and program values were added. The assessment was based on a series of qualitative data-gathering activities that included stakeholder groups and staff. Through surveys and interviews of applicants, inquirers, proposal reviewers, and staff, the authors provide a holistic view of the program, offer a series of recommendations, and identify areas for further attention.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This study reports on new research into the longevity of polyester-based magnetic audio tapes. Open-reel test tapes produced 10 to 20 years ago were subjected to a variety of accelerated temperature and relative humidity ranges, chosen to best predict and assess potential conditions for storage in institutions with and without controlled environmental options. Changes to the tapes&rsquo; physical, magnetic, and chemical properties were measured to assess their impact on the tapes&rsquo; usability. The results indicated that under standard room temperature conditions, the tapes tested may remain usable for as long as 100 years, more than doubling previous estimates, a finding that could have significant implications for preservation planning of audiovisual collections.</p>",

As 3D and VR projects scale up and move outside of the specialist disciplines where they have existed for decades, many academic libraries are taking the lead in supporting such projects because they are already centers for collaboration, instruction, research, and collection preservation.&nbsp;The volume seeks to prompt greater awareness for library professionals as they develop programs that use 3D and VR technologies and work to integrate changing scholarly demands and conventions with existing library services and policies.</p>\n\n<p>Chapters cover 3D content&nbsp;creation, VR visualization and analysis, 3D/VR-based educational deployment, and 3D/VR data curation, providing a snapshot of professional objectives and workflows that have developed around 3D/VR.</p>",

CLIR engaged a six-member team of consultants to conduct the assessment. Drawing on a review of NITLE&rsquo;s history, and interviews and surveys of past and current stakeholders, the assessment team identifies ways to build thoughtfully on NITLE&rsquo;s legacy to support the use of digital technologies in liberal education.</p>",

    "description": "<p>New U.S. government requirements for exposing and managing federally funded research data add urgency to the call for curating data that can be used, reused, and exploited by future generations.</p>\n\n<p>The Open Data Imperative: How the Cultural Heritage Community Can Address the Federal Mandate, offers a series of recommendations to improve the open data infrastructure, engage a broad community of stakeholders to support the management of data as an asset, and expand collaboration that is vital to ensuring public access to data.</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, the U.S. government issued a mandate requiring federal agencies with annual research and development expenditures of more than $100 million to create plans for increasing access to federally funded scientific research, both as published articles and as data. These plans have significant implications for cultural heritage institutions in addressing the current deficit in the capacity to support the re-use of data over time and across generations of technology (digital curation) and in enabling collaboration based on shared infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>The report&rsquo;s findings are drawn from three investigations: (1) an analysis of the plans of agencies subject to the federal mandate for open data; (2) interviews with staff of IMLS-supported projects that have developed model services and tools supporting data management; and (3) a survey of efforts to build capacity through continuing education programs and comprehensive workforce development.</p>\n\n<p>This project was made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (grant # RE-00-13-0097-13).</p>\n\n<p>The views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this publication do not necessarily represent those of the Institute of Museum and Library Services.</p>",

Copublished by the Association for Recorded Sound Collections, the Council on Library and Information Resources, and The Library of Congress</p>\n\n<p>The ARSC Guide to Audio Preservation is a practical introduction to caring for and preserving audio collections. It is aimed at individuals and institutions that have recorded sound collections but lack the expertise in one or more areas to preserve them.</p>\n\n<p>Our audio legacy is at serious risk because of media deterioration, technological obsolescence, and, often, lack of accessibility. This legacy is remarkable in its diversity, ranging from wax cylinders of extinct Native American languages to tapes of local radio broadcasts, naturalists&rsquo; and ethnographers&rsquo; field recordings, small independent record company releases, and much more. Saving this irreplaceable treasure demands the joint effort of libraries, archives, museums, local history repositories, corporations, and individuals. But for many institutions, the question is &ldquo;Where to begin?&rdquo; This guide addresses that question.</p>\n\n<p>Nine chapters, contributed by a range of experts, cover audio conservation and preservation, recorded sound formats and their associated risks, appraisal, related copyright issues, and disaster preparedness. The guide also offers advice on making informed decisions about digitization, as well as strategies for managing digital content. An appendix to the guide focuses on fair use and sound recordings.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In 2013, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded a group of librarians from ARL&rsquo;s Research Library Leadership Fellows program a planning grant to examine the center of excellence (CoE) model for information services. Used in a variety of industries, CoEs are designed to attract the most talented researchers in a particular field, enhance collaboration, and improve access to the resources needed for their research. The planning grant was awarded to determine whether the CoE model could serve as a means to provide the new services required for the effective use of digital information.</p>\n\n<p>This report describes the team&rsquo;s approach to examining the feasibility of CoEs in the library setting. The team conducted preliminary investigations of more than 100 centers, which they narrowed to 35 for in-depth research. Interviews were conducted with staff at 19 centers and 7 funding organizations. In their conclusion, the team advises developing &ldquo;networks of expertise&rdquo; or &ldquo;expert networks,&rdquo; instead of CoEs, and provides a series of recommendations for building such networks.</p>",

    "published": "2014-09-01",
    "description": "<p>Rapidly evolving digital technologies and services are profoundly influencing the financial model supporting many colleges and universities. Institutions that rely solely on traditional solutions to address the growing challenges to the higher education business model are unlikely to thrive. Colleges and universities must identify and seize new opportunities in light of new financial challenges.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2013, CLIR sponsored a workshop that explored the ways in which library and information technology services (LITS) organizations and academic institutions will need to evolve. Workshop participants-members of CLIR&rsquo;s Chief Information Officers (CIOs) group, responsible for integrated library and information technology services organizations-identified changes they would be likely to face in the next decade and what strategies they should adopt to prepare themselves for this future.</p>\n\n<p>CIOs Richard Holmgren, of Allegheny College, and Gene Spencer, of Ursinus College, draw on the workshop discussions to summarize the key challenges and opportunities facing LITS organizations. Developments of the past decade-from the ubiquity of cell phones to the growth of virtual server infrastructure and the maturation of open-source software support models-have created new opportunities for LITS organizations to improve student outcomes, increase revenue, and manage costs. The authors discuss these opportunities and identify the core competencies that LITS organizations will need to support positive institutional change in the decade ahead.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This report looks at how staff at eight academic institutions gained new insight about how students and faculty use their libraries, and how the staff are using these findings to improve library technologies, space, and services.</p>\n\n<p>Participatory design is a relatively recent approach to understanding library user behavior. It is based on techniques used in anthropological and ethnographic observation. The report&rsquo;s editor, anthropologist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sr.ithaka.org/people/nancy-fried-foster/\">Nancy Fried Foster</a>, led several participatory design workshops for CLIR from 2007 to 2013.</p>\n\n<p>The report is based on a series of presentations at the second CLIR Seminar on Participatory Design of Academic Libraries, held at the University of Rochester&rsquo;s River Campus June 5-7, 2013. Chapters focus on projects at the University of Colorado, Boulder; Colby College; University of Connecticut; Columbia University; Rush University Medical Center; Purdue University; Northwestern University; and the University of Rochester. David Lindahl, of the University of Missouri-Kansas City, provided the keynote. It is the second of two volumes published by CLIR that focus on participatory design. The first,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7799833\">Participatory Design in Academic Libraries: Methods, Findings, and Implementations</a>, was published in October 2012.</p>",

    "published": "2013-09-01",
    "description": "<p><em>Commissioned for and sponsored by the National Film Preservation Board, Library of Congress.</em></p>\n\n<p>The era of the American silent feature film lasted from 1912 until 1929. During that time, filmmakers established the language of cinema, and the motion pictures they created reached a height of artistic sophistication. These films, with their recognizable stars and high production values, spread American culture around the world. Silent feature films disappeared from sight soon after the coming of sound, and many vanished from existence.</p>\n\n<p>This report focuses on those titles that have managed to survive to the present day and represents the first comprehensive survey of the survival of American silent feature films. Mr. Pierce&rsquo;s findings tell us that only 14% of the feature films produced in the United States during the period 1912&ndash;1929 survive in the format in which they were originally produced and distributed, i.e., as complete works on 35mm film. Another 11% survive in full-length foreign versions or on film formats of lesser image quality such as 16mm and other smaller gauge formats.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Pierce has also created a valuable da&shy;tabase of location information on the archival film holdings identified in the course of his research.

Congress specified that the program established by the Librarian of Congress under this legislation &ldquo;shall &hellip; increase accessibility of sound recordings for educational purposes.&rdquo; Preserved recordings can benefit the public only if they are made available for listening. Technological, institutional, and legal impediments to broadened access create daunting challenges for the national preservation effort. This plan identifies the audio field&rsquo;s most important preservation and access problems and offers recommendations for surmounting them.</p>",

This report summarizes the activities and discussions that took place during the workshop, describes what came out of the workshop, outlines next steps identified by the participants, and provides contextual and background information, including preliminary reports and biographies of workshop participants. The workshop report was produced and edited by the participants and staff at Stanford University Libraries.</p>\n\n<p>As background for workshop participants, CLIR commissioned Jerry Persons, technology analyst at Knowledge Motifs and Chief Information Architect emeritus at Stanford, to produce a survey of the linked-data landscape, and the projects and individuals associated with it. The survey focuses on the practical aspects of understanding and applying linked data practices and technologies to the metadata and content of libraries, museums, and archives. There are numerous links in the report and the survey that lead readers to many other sources and examples regarding the use of linked data methods.</p>\n\n<p>The workshop and survey were supported by a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, by CLIR, and by the Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources.</p>",

    "published": "2010-12-01",
    "description": "<p>While the purview of digital forensics was once specialized to fields of law enforcement, computer security, and national defense, the increasing ubiquity of computers and electronic devices means that digital forensics is now used in a wide variety of cases and circumstances. Most records today are born digital, and libraries and other collecting institutions increasingly receive computer storage media as part of their acquisition of &ldquo;papers&rdquo; from writers, scholars, scientists, musicians, and public figures. This poses new challenges to librarians, archivists, and curators-challenges related to accessing and preserving legacy formats, recovering data, ensuring authenticity, and maintaining trust. The methods and tools developed by forensics experts represent a novel approach to these demands. For example, the same forensics software that indexes a criminal suspect&rsquo;s hard drive allows the archivist to prepare a comprehensive manifest of the electronic files a donor has turned over for accession.</p>\n\n<p>This report introduces the field of digital forensics in the cultural heritage sector and explores some points of convergence between the interests of those charged with collecting and maintaining born-digital cultural heritage materials and those charged with collecting and maintaining legal evidence.</p>",

    "title": "The State of Recorded Sound Preservation in the United States: A National Legacy at Risk in the Digital Age",
    "published": "2010-08-01",
    "description": "<p>This is the first comprehensive, national-level study of the state of sound recording preservation ever conducted in the U.S. The authors, Rob Bamberger and Sam Brylawski, have produced a study outlining the web of interlocking issues that now threaten the long-term survival of our sound recording history. This study tells us that major areas of America&rsquo;s recorded sound heritage have already been destroyed or remain inaccessible to the public. It suggests that the lack of conformity between federal and state laws may adversely affect the long-term survival of pre-1972-era sound recordings in particular. And, it warns that the continued lack of national coordination among interested parties in the public and private sectors, in addressing the challenges in preservation, professional education and public access, may not yet be arresting permanent loss of irreplaceable sound recordings in all genres.</p>\n\n<p>This study lays the groundwork for the National Recording Preservation Plan that was mandated under the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 and will be published by the Library of Congress later in 2010. The National Recording Preservation Plan will make specific recommendations for addressing the complex problems revealed by The State of Recorded Sound Preservation in the United States.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The Idea of Order</em>&nbsp;explores the transition from an analog to a digital environment for knowledge access, preservation, and reconstitution, and the implications of this transition for managing research collections. The volume comprises three reports. The first, &ldquo;Can a New Research Library be All-Digital?&rdquo; by Lisa Spiro and Geneva Henry, explores the degree to which a new research library can eschew print. The second, &ldquo;On the Cost of Keeping a Book,&rdquo; by Paul Courant and Matthew &ldquo;Buzzy&rdquo; Nielsen, argues that from the perspective of long-term storage, digital surrogates offer a considerable cost savings over print-based libraries. The final report, &ldquo;Ghostlier Demarcations,&rdquo; examines how well large text databases being created by Google Books and other mass-digitization efforts meet the needs of scholars, and the larger implications of these projects for research, teaching, and publishing.</p>\n\n<p>The reports are introduced by Charles Henry; the volume includes a conclusion by Roger Schonfeld and an epilogue by Charles Henry.</p>",

    "published": "2009-03-01",
    "description": "<p>This report addresses the question of what libraries and archives are legally empowered to do to preserve and make accessible for research their holdings of unpublished pre-1972 sound recordings. The report&rsquo;s author, June M. Besek, is executive director of the Kernochan Center for Law, Media and the Arts at Columbia Law School.</p>\n\n<p>Unpublished sound recordings are those created for private use, or even for broadcast, but that have not been distributed to the public in copies with the right holder&rsquo;s consent. Examples include tapes of live musical performances or of interviews conducted as part of field research or news gathering. Such recordings may find their way into library and archive collections through donations or purchase. Some may be the only record of a particular performance or event, and therefore may have considerable cultural and historical significance. The rights for use of unpublished recordings are distinct from those for use of commercial sound recordings, which are made with the authorization of rights holders and are intended for reproduction and sale to the public.</p>\n\n<p>Using examples of specific types of sound recordings, the Besek study (1) describes the different bodies of law that protect pre-1972 sound recordings, (2) explains the difficulty in defining the precise contours of the law, and (3) provides guidance for libraries evaluating their activities with respect to unpublished pre-1972 sound recordings.</p>",

The aim of these large-scale projects-to make content accessible-is interwoven with the question of how one keeps that content, whether digital or print, fit for use over time.</p>\n\n<p>This report by Oya Y. Rieger examines large-scale digital initiatives (LSDIs) to identify issues that will influence the availability and usability, over time, of the digital books these projects create. Ms. Rieger is interim assistant university librarian for digital library and information technologies at the Cornell University Library.</p>\n\n<p>The paper describes four large-scale projects-Google Book Search, Microsoft Live Search Books, Open Content Alliance, and the Million Book Project-and their digitization strategies. It then discusses a range of issues affecting the stewardship of the digital collections they create: selection, quality in content creation, technical infrastructure, and organizational infrastructure. The paper also attempts to foresee the likely impacts of large-scale digitization on book collections.</p>",

    "title": "Library Workflow Redesign: Six Case Studies",
    "published": "2006-09-02",
    "description": "<p>The proliferation of electronic information and tools has changed the way that readers and researchers do their work. It has also changed the way library staff members provide materials and services. Several years ago a group of liberal arts college librarians, realizing the need to streamline processes to serve changing needs, asked CLIR to help.</p>\n\n<p>With support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, CLIR offered workflow redesign support to teams from six institutions that are part of consortia. This volume documents their work. These institutions were pioneers. Now the issue of workflow redesign appears to be on the minds not only of librarians in small institutions, but also of many librarians in research libraries. We hope that this publication can be the beginning of describing changing work patterns, and that it can be followed by additional publications, both in print and through the CLIR Web site, on imaginative ways of providing good services in a shifting environment.</p>",

    "published": "2006-09-01",
    "description": "<p>This report summarizes a review of 12 e-journal archiving programs from the perspective of concerns expressed by directors of academic libraries in North America. It uses a methodology comparable to the art of surveying land by &ldquo;metes and bounds&rdquo; in the era before precise measures and calibrated instruments were available. It argues that current license arrangements are inadequate to protect a library&rsquo;s long-term interest in electronic journals, that individual libraries cannot address the preservation needs of e-journals on their own, that much scholarly e-literature is not covered by archiving arrangements, and that while e-journal archiving programs are becoming available, no comprehensive solution has emerged and large parts of e-literature go unprotected.</p>",

To what extent does the age of the material influence permission decisions? This report, by Denise Troll Covey, principal librarian for special projects at Carnegie Mellon University, responds to many of these questions. It begins with a brief, cogent overview of U.S. copyright laws, licensing practices, and technological developments in publishing that serve as the backdrop for the current environment. It then recounts in detail three efforts undertaken at Carnegie-Mellon University to secure copyright permission to digitize and provide open access to books with scholarly content.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Many academic and research libraries are in the midst of what may ultimately be a major transition for various parts of their collections-a shift from print to electronic format. Libraries that had long subscribed only to print versions of journals are, in increasing numbers, licensing electronic versions to replace the print. What effects will this transition have on library operations and on nonsubscription expenditures? To answer this question, the authors collected new data on staff activities and costs from 11 U.S. academic libraries. They then performed a life-cycle analysis to study the longer-term cost implications of the transition.</p>",

Scholars, library directors, university administrators, publishers, collectors, and representatives from the legal and preservation communities came together to explore the challenges posed by the shifting information landscape and to propose directions that can be taken by all in research and education who have an interest in the well-being of research and cultural heritage collections.</p>\n\n<p>To frame the discussion, CLIR asked four experts to address key features of the changing landscape. Their papers are presented here, prefaced by a brief overview of the information landscape and followed by a concluding essay on the implications of their findings.</p>\n\n<p>By publishing this report, CLIR hopes to broaden understanding of how creators, publishers, distributors, and information seekers can work more actively with libraries and archives to ensure the usability and accessibility of recorded information into the future.</p>",

    "description": "<p>To what extent have recent library design projects been driven by an understanding of how students learn and how faculty teach? To find out, Yale Librarian Emeritus Scott Bennett conducted an extensive study of the motivations and planning methods for library renovation and construction projects undertaken between 1992 and 2001. His study entailed a Web-based survey of more than 380 institutions, and phone interviews with 31 library directors and chief academic officers. He concludes that while most of the projects are serving users well, they have rarely been informed by a systematic assessment of how students learn and faculty teach. The author suggests that planning based on such an assessment could equip the library to serve an even more vital function as a space for teaching and learning.</p>\n\n<p>The report is intended for academic librarians who are responsible for library construction and renovation projects, and for campus academic officers who wish to engage substantively with the question of how library space can advance the core learning and teaching missions of their institutions.</p>",

This report is the result of that study. Authors Bernard Reilly and Barbara DesRosiers looked broadly at existing shared repositories. Their report includes information about both regional repositories and those that collect on behalf of an entire nation. While carefully documenting the growth and achievements of such facilities, Reilly and DesRosiers also point to the promises they hold for new collaborative solutions to problems that libraries share but are used to grappling with on their own.</p>",

    "published": "2003-04-01",
    "description": "<p>This report is the product of a planning grant awarded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 2001 to the Tri-College Library Consortium, which comprises the libraries of Bryn Mawr, Haverford and Swarthmore Colleges. The grant proposal, entitled &ldquo;Library Buildings and the Building of a Collaborative Research Collection at the Tri-Colleges,&rdquo; set out a research agenda designed to address two central questions. The first question was a challenge: How could the three libraries come to terms with space problems caused by ever-growing collections and increasing demands to accommodate media, teaching, and student study areas in an environment in which library building expansion was a remote possibility? The second question was an opportunity: Could the libraries take advantage of their history of cooperation and the powerful tool of a unified online catalog to create a single research-quality collection out of the combined holdings of three strong liberal arts colleges?</p>\n\n<p>Working with a consultant, a seven-member Planning Group representing the three colleges and the consortium gathered data on the collections, convened focus groups of faculty and students, and engaged three publishing industry experts to assess the state of electronic publishing. After analyzing the data, the Planning Group studied alternatives for maximizing collection space and made recommendations for new models and strategies to be pursued by the Tri-Colleges consortium.</p>",

    "title": "New-Model Scholarship: How Will It Survive?",
    "published": "2003-03-01",
    "description": "<p>In 2002, with support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, CLIR hosted a meeting of scholars, librarians, archivists, technologists, publishers, and funders to discuss the preservation of digital scholarly resources. The goal of the workshop was to identify the needs of various stakeholders-Web site creators; distributors and publishers of digital materials; representatives of archives, libraries, and repositories that want to collect these sites and make them available; end users; and anyone in the chain of scholarly communication who might want to discover and use these works for their own purposes-and to agree on common approaches to meeting those needs.</p>\n\n<p>This report is informed by the lively discussions that took place at that conference, and by two papers that were circulated in advance and which are included as Appendixes. The author describes the scope of problems posed by preserving Web-based scholarly resources. It focuses on &ldquo;new-model scholarship&rdquo;-scholarship that is born digital and constitutes an important source for present and future research and teaching. The new-model scholarship is, specifically, the variety of Web sites and other desktop digital objects that faculty and graduate students are creating that fall somewhere short of &ldquo;published&rdquo; but are worthy of access into the future.</p>",

    "published": "2003-01-01",
    "description": "<p>The collection and long-term preservation of digital content pose challenges to the intellectual property regime within which libraries and archives are accustomed to working. How to achieve an appropriate balance between copyright owners and users is a topic of ongoing debate in legal and policy circles. This paper describes copyright rights and exceptions and highlights issues potentially involved in the creation of a nonprofit digital archive. The paper is necessarily very general, since many decisions concerning the proposed archive&rsquo;s scope and operation have not yet been made. The purpose of an archive (e.g., to ensure preservation or to provide an easy and convenient means of access), its subject matter, and the manner in which it will acquire copies, as well as who will have access to the archive, from where, and under what conditions, are all factors critical to determining the copyright implications for works to be included in it. The goal of this paper is to provide basic information about the copyright law for those developing such an archive and thereby enable them to recognize areas in which it could impinge on copyright rights and to plan accordingly.</p>",

    "description": "<p>With funding from the Institute for Museum and Library Services, the Council on Library and Information Resources, ARL, the University Libraries Group, and the Regional Alliance for Preservation conducted a joint study in 2001 to examine the state of preservation programs in American academic libraries. The study was conducted in two phases and relied on qualitative as well as quantitative data gathering.</p>\n\n<p>In Phase I, statistical information and other quantitative data relevant to preservation activity were collected in a survey of 116 libraries from the University Libraries Group, major non-ARL land grant institutions, and leading liberal arts colleges in what is informally known as the Oberlin Group. These data were compared with information that had been published in ARL Preservation Statistics for 2000-2001.</p>\n\n<p>Phase II focused on obtaining qualitative data to complement the statistical data. Qualitative data were gathered by means of 20 site visits to institutions that represented the three surveyed groups plus the ARL.</p>\n\n<p>Anne R. Kenney, then director of programs at CLIR, served as project director. Deirdre C. Stam served as project consultant.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Digital libraries, once project based and largely autonomous efforts, are maturing. As individual programs have grown, each has developed its own personality, reflecting the circumstances of its creation and environment, and its leadership. This report from CLIR and the Digital Library Federation (DLF) draws on the results of a survey and case studies of DLF members to reveal how these influences have molded a range of organizational forms that we call the digital library.</p>\n\n<p>The report is written by Daniel Greenstein and Suzanne Thorin. Greenstein, formerly the director of the DLF, is now university librarian for systemwide library planning and scholarly information and director of the California Digital Library. Thorin is the dean of university libraries at Indiana University.</p>\n\n<p>Section one of the report examines three stages of digital library growth: the young digital library, the maturing digital library, and the adult digital library.

    "published": "2002-08-01",
    "description": "<p>Research libraries are taking on a range of new roles in the digital age as they become more deeply engaged in the creation and dissemination of knowledge. While some of these roles are extensions of traditional library activity, others are largely new. Wendy Lougee, university librarian at the University of Minnesota, explores some of these emerging functions in this report.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nLougee includes several examples of how some libraries and library organizations are forging new services in areas of collection development, information access, and user services; she also touches briefly on the continued importance of library as place. In addition, she suggests where new roles might emerge. In the section on information access, for example, she notes the potential for libraries to contribute to the development of the Semantic Web, which aims to develop languages for expressing information in a form that machines can process, and which therefore can be searched more accurately and efficiently. She writes, &ldquo;Designing the Semantic Web will require a mix of skills, and librarians have the potential to contribute significantly to this effort.&rdquo; She also notes that there is a potential role for the library in certifying the authenticity and provenance of content on the Semantic Web.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In December 2000, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to the Library of Congress (LC) to spearhead an effort to develop a national strategy for the preservation of digital information. Understanding that the task cannot be accomplished by any one organization, Congress wrote into the appropriations language a requirement that LC work with other federal, scholarly, and nonprofit organizations to discuss the problem and produce a plan.</p>\n\n<p>The staff of the Library of Congress immediately scheduled a series of conversations with representatives from the technology, business, entertainment, academic, legal, archival, and library communities. LC asked the Council on Library and Information Resources to commission background papers for these sessions and to summarize the meetings. The resulting papers, along with an integrative essay by Amy Friedlander, are presented in this document.</p>",

Covey&rsquo;s work is also an essential methodological guidebook. For each method that she covers, she is careful to supply a definition, explain why and how libraries use the method, what they do with the results, and what problems they encounter.

Assessing and responding to those changes is essential for the academic library so that it may continue in support of the scholarly mission. The authors of this report have formally examined how humanities scholars conduct and collate their research. The study was based on a small sample of scholars; nonetheless, the results are powerfully suggestive of ways in which academic libraries can adapt to and develop in a rapidly changing environment. In particular, the findings emphasize how important it is for libraries to chart their evolutionary course in close consultation with scholarly user communities.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nThis study results from the fruitful cross-fertilization between the scholar concerned with aspects of information science and the librarian concerned with delivering operational information services.</p>",

    "published": "2001-11-01",
    "description": "<p>Although film and digital technology have made the intellectual content of artifacts far more accessible to researchers, scholars have an abiding interest in consulting the original. Maintaining original artifacts while also providing increased access to surrogates poses new challenges to university and library administrators, who must make difficult choices about how to invest in information resources.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nIn 1999, CLIR convened a task force of scholars, academic officers, librarians, and archivists to investigate the role of artifacts-original, unreformatted materials-in library and archival collections, and the value of those materials for scholarship and teaching. The inquiry was sparked by a recognition of the growing tension between how much information is produced and how much can be acquired, preserved, and made accessible in meaningful ways. The task force members were asked to articulate a framework for making or evaluating institutional policies for the retention of published materials and archival or unpublished materials in their original form.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nThe report deals in detail with the ways in which artifacts and their physical frailties affect their research value-originality, faithfulness, fixity, and stability-over time and with how libraries can minimize the risk of unacceptable loss of that value. It investigates the specific issues around selected media, such as paper-based printed matter, moving image and recorded sound materials, and objects that exist in digital form, and points to two key strategies-preventive maintenance and use of surrogates-currently in use in libraries that can be scaled up to deal with a problem of this magnitude. Specific recommendations are provided for different media.</p>",

What should these professionals be prepared to do? The very question raises a host of other questions about the future of the information infrastructure and how and where knowledge will be created, kept, and made available.</p>\n\n<p>These papers, written by leading Chinese and American educators, provide a snapshot of the educators&rsquo; concerns at a time when the digital environment is bringing about rapid, fundamental change in libraries. As Diane Perushek notes in her introduction, there is a high degree of commonality in the concerns expressed by participants from both countries, despite the quite different paths that the library profession has followed in each.</p>",

    "published": "2001-09-01",
    "description": "<p>In April 2000, the Digital Library Federation commissioned three reports to address broader concerns about digital collections in research libraries. This report synthesizes the nearly 10 years&#39; experience that libraries have had digitizing items from their rare, special, and general collections, and making them available online. The report demonstrates that digitization programs work best where their role within a library&#39;s collection development strategy is clearly understood, and identifies several roles that such programs can play. The author muses about the extent to which digitally reformatted special and rare collections can actually support scholarly research, and looks at whether leading research libraries in particular might more usefully focus on digitizing general as opposed to special and rare collections. The report opens with points to consider in developing a sustainable strategy. The second section addresses identification, evaluation and selection, discussing polices, guidelines and best practices, and rationales for digitization. The third section focuses on institutional impacts and discusses treatment and disposition of source materials, scalability, intellectual control and data management, coordinated collection development, funding, preservation, and support of users. A final section addresses challenges in evaluating costs and benefits, and offers recommendations.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This report offers a case study in the advantages and disadvantages of depository libraries, their economics, and the practical and political issues associated with their creation. As director of the library at Amherst College, the author played a key role in establishing the initial off-site storage facility, as well as in broadening its service to the Five Colleges, Inc. (Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst). As libraries change in response to budgetary constraints as well as developments in information technology, the Five College Library Depository model suggests new possibilities for collection management and ways for libraries to reframe their service missions. The questions facing all academic libraries--to what extent can they provide access to materials that they do not own, and which materials must they preserve for future generations--are examined in this report. Contents include: alternatives to open-shelf storage of library materials; continuing net growth of paper collections; off-site storage considerations; establishment of the Amherst College Library Depository; the proposal for a Five-College Library Depository; anticipated implementation and operation; Five-College Collection Management Committee; academic department reactions to the proposed depository; and a national trend toward academic depository libraries.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The American Folklore Society and the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress collaborated on a conference, &quot;Folk Heritage Collections in Crisis,&quot; held on December 1-2, 2000, and gathered experts to formulate recommendations for the preservation and access of America&#39;s folk heritage sound collections. To facilitate informed discussion at the conference, the organizers commissioned papers on three major factors affecting the long-term accessibility of folklore collections: access, preservation, and rights management. The papers, reproduced in this document with the discussions they provoked, were sent to participants before the conference and formed the basis for discussion at three sessions. The papers are: &quot;Stating the Obvious: Lessons Learned Attempting Access to Archival Audio Collections&quot; (Virginia Danielson); &quot;Preservation of Audio&quot; (Elizabeth Cohen); and &quot;Intellectual Property and Audiovisual Archives and Collections&quot; (Anthony Seeger). On the second day of the conference, participants crafted recommended actions that are also reported in this document. As background information for the conference, a survey was conducted of the holdings of the members of several folklore societies and major repositories. A summary of the results is provided in an appendix. Conference participants are also listed.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This paper provides a snapshot of developments in the electronic journal industry. The first section identifies issues affecting librarians and publishers, including: (1) issues of common concern to both publishers and librarians, e.g., lack of comparable data, lack of context, incomplete usage data, marketing, content provided, interface affecting usage, economic model, and user privacy; (2) library issues, e.g., budget justification and impact on selection; and (3) a publisher issue, internal applications. Quantitative measures are discussed in the second section, including what data elements should be collected and data reliability. The third section suggests a meeting at which publishers who have already implemented statistical functionality can share what they have learned, including producing useful data and interpreting the data. Appendices include summaries of interviews with librarians and publishers, the ICOLC (International Coalition of Library Consortia) &ldquo;Guidelines for Statistical Measures of Usage of Web-Based Indexed, Abstracted, and Full Text Resources,&rdquo; and descriptions of related industry initiatives.</p>",

    "title": "Risk Management of Digital Information: A File Format Investigation",
    "published": "2000-06-01",
    "description": "<p>Given the right hardware and software, digital information is easy to create, copy, and disseminate; however it is very hard to preserve. At present, it is impossible to guarantee the longevity and legibility of digital information for even one human generation. Migration can be defined as the periodic transfer of digital materials from one hardware/software configuration to another or from one generation of computer technology to a subsequent generation. In 1998, the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) asked the Cornell University Library to undertake a risk assessment of migrating a handful of common file formats. This report is the fruit of their investigation. It is intended to be a practical guide to assessing the risks associated with the migration of various formats and to making sound preservation decisions on the basis of that assessment. The paper starts from the premise that migration is prone to generating errors and provides practical tools to quantify the risks. It organizes migration into a sequence of discrete steps and offer assessment tools to manage each of those steps. The process is presented in a workbook that can guide digital preservation specialists in their day-to-day operations. Two case studies are also presented--one for image files and another for numeric files. Findings and Recommendations are discussed under four areas: Migration Risk Can Be Qualified; Conversion Software; Access to Format Data; and Public Access Archives of Format Information.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This report provides an overview of knowledge organization systems (KOSs) and includes pertinent examples of their application to digital materials, offering extensive practical information for institutions embarking on digital library initiatives. The first section of the report defines the general characteristics of KOSs, with emphasis on their connection to a particular view of the world. The historic origins and uses of KOSs, in libraries and in other information management environments, are described, and various types of KOSs are discussed. The second section provides examples of how KOSs can be used to enhance digital libraries in a variety of disciplines, and describes how a KOS can be used to link a digital resource to related material. The third section discusses how KOSs can be used to provide disparate communities with access to digital library resources by using a KOS to provide alternate subject access, to add a new mode of access to the digital library, to provide multilingual access, or to support free-text searching. The report concludes with a discussion of issues to consider when using KOSs with digital libraries. It provides a framework for the design, planning, implementation, and maintenance of KOSs in digital libraries.</p>",

    "published": "1999-11-01",
    "description": "<p>The project to translate into Portuguese and disseminate preservation knowledge was part of a broader partnership between the Council on Library and Information Resources, which incorporates the former Commission on Preservation and Access, and a consortium of Brazilian archival, library, and museum institutions. The partnership was intended to serve as an information network for preventative conservation for all Brazilian institutions with collections on paper and film and in digital form. This included federal, state, and municipal institutions; public and private museums; universities; and local cultural institutions and foundations. Following the project&#39;s successful first phase in 1998, it received the highest cultural heritage award presented by Brazil&#39;s Ministry of Culture. This report gives an overview of the project that discusses the origins, organization and funding, objectives, and results. It then outlines \\&quot;The Blueprint Phases One: 1996-1997\\&quot; which discusses the documentation in Portuguese, institutional database, core workshops, and regional workshops. \\&quot;The Blueprint, Phase Two: 1998-1999\\&quot; discusses new workshops, survey, Web site launch, and publications. Lessons learned and recommendations are also outlined. Appendices include the translated titles, institutional database questionnaire, and contact information for collaborative institutions and workgroup members.</p>",

    "published": "1999-08-01",
    "description": "<p>The Council on Library and Information Resources&#39; (CLIR&#39;s) College Libraries Committee began its study of the innovative uses of technology on college campuses in the spring of 1998. A letter was sent to heads of libraries of colleges and mid-sized universities in the United States encouraging librarians who felt their institutions had used technology in a way that significantly enhanced teaching and learning and who were willing to host a study team for a site visit to apply to the project. Nine campuses were selected out of the 41 applicants and site visits were conducted between September 1998 and January 1999. A two-day conference in March 1999 focused on the environment that is most conducive to organizational change. Representatives from each of the nine case study sites were present to discuss which features of the programs they studied had been most successful. Sites included: (1) California Institute of Technology, Sherman Fairchild Library - A New High-Tech Library; (2) Carnegie Mellon University - A New Electronic Archives; (3) Indiana University/Purdue University at Indianapolis - Librarian-Scholar Collaboration in Learning Communities; (4) Lafayette College - An Interdisciplinary Team Approach; (5) Point Park College and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Library Center - A Public-Private Library Partnership; (6) Southern Utah University, Gerald R. Sherratt Library - One Librarian Introduces EAD (Encoded Archival Description) Finding Aids; (7) Stevens Institute of Technology - Electronic Access, Not Subscriptions; (8) Wellesley College, Margaret Clapp Library - A New High-Tech Center; and (9) West Virginia Wesleyan College - Laptops for Every Student. Four speakers provided additional perspective on the case studies. William Haden opened the conference by noting that with rapid developments in information technology, colleges today face new pressures to remain relevant, competitive, and effective. This was followed by two presentations, by Susan Jurow and Barbara Hill, on making change in higher education. Brian Hawkins then prepared participants with observations on the transformation of higher education. The presentations are provided in part 1 of this report, as are summaries of the ensuing discussion and recommendations for follow-up activities. Case studies appear in part 2 of the report. The CLIR Belmont conference participant list is appended.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The great research collections of the United States have resulted, in part, from a long and productive collaboration among scholars, librarians, and archivists. This booklet focuses on the documentation of, access to, and preservation of dance heritage. It discusses the cultural and intellectual value of dance and articulates what elements of dance should be recorded and made accessible so that scholars, performers, creators, and the public can grasp fully the rich history of human expression embodied in dance. It also explores the various strategies used for making those resources accessible and the challenges of preserving the fragile media on which these sources are recorded.</p>",

    "published": "1999-06-01",
    "description": "<p>Focusing on the experience of the Yale University (Connecticut) social science data preservation project, this document presents a case study of migration as a preservation strategy, exploring options for migrating data stored in a technically obsolete format and their associated documentation stored on paper. The first section provides background and a project description, an overview of the Yale Roper Collection of public opinion research data sets and paper records, and a summary of the literature search. The following nine steps of the data track are described in the second section: identify equipment; copy files from mainframe-based media to local hard disks; examine documentation; define the column binary format; develop standard variable-naming classifications; read in data with SAS (Statistical Analysis System) and SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences); identify migration formats; recode data files with SAS; and create spread ASCII data files without recoding. The next section addresses the documentation track, including software/equipment, TextBridge Pro optical character recognition software, PDF (portable document format) files from Adobe Capture, and HTML and SGML/XML marked-up files. Findings and recommendations are presented in the fourth section, including user evaluation, findings about data/documentation conversion, and recommendations to data producers. A glossary is included, and support documents are appended.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This paper gives an overview of the preservation and management of research collections and describes the context in which decisions are made by researchers and librarians about what to preserve and how. By examining how librarians and scholars grappled with the first great crisis in the preservation of library materials-the pandemic loss of information printed on embrittled acid paper-it traces the development of the current consensus on how to manage large collections recorded on many media of varying stability. And the paper addresses the problem that, despite striking progress made in preservation technology and management, the difficulties of preserving original library materials have scarcely diminished over time and demand the same thoughtful cooperation between scholars and librarians as they enter the twenty-first century as the brittle-book problem received in the 1980s.</p>",

    "published": "1999-02-01",
    "description": "<p>On April 6, 1998, the Digital Library Federation (DLF) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored a one-day workshop on ways to improve systems of managing access to digital information. The workshop was convened to provide input from research libraries with a focus on requirements for access management systems that can be designed and deployed in today&#39;s technical, legal, and economic environment. Participants identified these five key properties for the design and adoption of systems that enable access for users while respecting the rights and interests of authors and publishers: (1) simplicity; (2) privacy; (3) good faith; (4) trusted intermediaries; and (5) reasonable terms. Participants also recommended research and project evaluation in two key areas: system usability and economic models. Although the conclusions reached at this workshop relate specifically to the problems of managing access to the cultural record in digital form for research and teaching purposes, they apply to other realms as well, including business, medicine, insurance, credit card transactions, and logfiles from Web browsers, all of which involve more sensitive information. This report describes the opening statements and invited presentations of the workshop, and summarizes the workshop discussions under three thematic headings: technical assumptions, issues affecting user acceptance, and points that address specific questions posed. Unanticipated issues that do not fit these categories are also described. Appendices list participants, suggested readings, and definitions, and provide an update on related legislative activity.</p>",

Faculty are urged to make increased use of primary source materials to develop critical thinking in students; (3) library organizations and learned societies should explore the possibilities of exploiting and managing intellectual property to yield greater benefits to the scholarly communities; (4) institutions of higher education and research should place more emphasis on training and support for faculty use of information and instructional technologies; (5) There is too little sharing of information to enable the scholarly community to participate in the philosophical and policy issues arising from the use of information technology in research and teaching, as well as in libraries.

    "published": "1999-01-01",
    "description": "<p>There is as yet no viable long-term strategy to ensure that digital information will be readable in the future. Digital documents are vulnerable to loss via the decay and obsolescence of the media on which they are stored, and they become inaccessible and unreadable when the software needed to interpret them, or the hardware on which that software runs, becomes obsolete and is lost. This report explores the technical depth of the problem of long-term digital document preservation, analyzes the inadequacies of a number of ideas that have been proposed as solutions, and elaborates the emulation strategy. The central idea of the emulation strategy is to emulate obsolete systems on future, unknown systems, so that a digital document&#39;s original software can be run in the future despite being obsolete. Contents of this report are as follows: (1) Introduction (stating the digital preservation problem and introducing the emulation strategy); (2) The Digital Longevity Problem; (3) Preservation in the Digital Age; (4) The Scope of the Problem; (5) Technical Dimensions of the Problem; (6) The Inadequacy of Most Proposed Approaches; (7) Criteria for an Ideal Solution; (8) The Emulation Solution; (9) Research Required for the Emulation Approach; and (10) Summary.</p>",

    "title": "SGML as a Framework for Digital Preservation and Access",
    "published": "1997-07-01",
    "description": "<p>This report explores the suitability of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) as a framework for building, managing, and providing access to digital libraries, with special emphasis on preservation and access issues. SGML is an international standard (ISO 8879) designed to promote text interchange. It is used to define markup languages, which can then encode the logical structure and content of any so-defined document. The connection between SGML and the traditional concerns of preservation and access may not be immediately apparent, but the use of descriptive markup tools such as SGML is crucial to the quality and long-term accessibility of digitized materials. Beginning with a general exploration of digital formats for preservation and access, the report provides a staged technical tutorial on the features and uses of SGML. The tutorial covers SGML and related standards, SGML Document Type Definitions in current use, and related projects now under development. A tiered metadata model is described that could incorporate SGML along with other standards to facilitate discovery and retrieval of digital documents. Endnotes and a bibliography provide further resources. Appendices include: a discussion of practical concerns related to the uses of SGML in conversion and authoring projects, descriptions of markup format and SGML tools, and a vendor&#39;s look at cost metrics. The report concludes that SGML meets current preservation and access requirements for digital libraries and that SGML solves the widest range of archival database problems today: SGML is a standard; it is non-proprietary and platform-independent; and it allows rich, full access to content-based digital documents. The SGML framework should be seriously considered when planning digital library projects.</p>",

This study is intended primarily to support the development of a well-considered preservation policy by librarians and archivists, with a focus on the practical implications of mass deacidification rather than the technical details of the deacidification process. The study provides a brief history of the development of the technical process, a condensed description of the treatment principle, an overview of available research and test results, indicating the main advantages and disadvantages of the process, and an inventory of actual applications for five mass deacidification systems: (1) &quot;Battelle&quot;; (2) &quot;Bookkeeper&quot;; (3) &quot;DEZ&quot;; (4) &quot;FMC&quot;; and (5) &quot;Wei T&#39;o.&quot; Several other initiatives are also described, involving large-scale rather than mass treatment technologies, and essentially combining deacidification with strengthening of paper. The main findings are discussed within the framework of a critical evaluation of the current possibilities and limitations of mass deacidification in general. A list of contacts is provided.&nbsp;</p>",

    "published": "1996-09-01",
    "description": "<p>n Russia today, substantial political, economic, and social changes directly affect the preservation efforts of libraries and archives. Prepared by the Deputy Director General of the M. I. Rudomino All-Russia State Library for Foreign Literature in Moscow, this report presents a distinctly Russian perspective on the ways in which libraries and archives are attempting to adapt to widespread changes while seeking to maintain their services and introduce new technologies, all with decreasing financial resources. Russian libraries require financial support in addition to verbal support in order to put into action the plans that already exist for preserving Russia&#39;s national heritage. This report provides an insider&#39;s viewpoint of where preservation efforts stand in Russia. The report covers the following topics: (1) Background--Libraries Under the Soviet Regime, and Preservation Problems; (2) A New Political Environment and its Impact on Preservation--Library Laws for Critical Needs, and Coordinating Functions; (3) The National Preservation Program: Myth or Reality?; (4) Cooperation: National and International Aspects--First Efforts, Other Microfilm Projects, and Microfilm Storage Facilities; (5) Preservation Challenges--Raising Awareness, Management, Preservation Centers, Limitations of Digital Technology, Permanent Paper, and Training; and (6) Closing Remarks.</p>",

This new approach to preservation management applies to the many types of scholarly resources for which research and academic institutions are responsible. The Time-Weighted Preservation Index (TWPI) provides a new way to measure and quantify how temperature and humidity changes affect the preservation quality of storage environments for paper, photographic, and magnetic tape collections, and any other type of organic material. The concept is illustrated with examples and explanations are given on how relatively small changes in storage conditions can result in significant improvements in the useful life of library and archives collections. Plans for the Preservation Environment Monitor are also described. Appendices provide information on the following: forms of deterioration in organic collection materials, deterioration mechanisms and test methods; specific origins of the preservation index (PI) model and how the PI model compares with other published models; and temperature and RH equilibration in TWPI analysis.</p>",

    "title": "\"Difficult Choices:\" How Can Scholars Help Save Endangered Research Resources?",
    "published": "1995-08-01",
    "description": "<p>This report caps an 8-year initiative that has had as its goal the recruitment and formation of scholarly committees to investigate the state of decay and preservation of collections within their separate disciplines. The Commission began to investigate strategies for preservation selection in 1988. By 1995, the Commission had worked with scholars in six fields, forming scholarly advisory committees in history, art history, medieval studies, modern languages, and literature, philosophy, and Renaissance studies. Scholars in additional fields, including some of the sciences, have also been included through an interdisciplinary task force on the special problems for preserving research materials containing texts linked with images. At least two broad themes emerge in this report: the understandable reluctance of scholars to make choices because of the unpredictability of research needs, and the advisability of collaborative, cross-institutional preservation. Based on the committees&#39; work, the report suggests that a preferred option is for the Commission to work with scholarly associations in order to take leadership responsibility for preserving materials of priority importance for their fields. These committees could also bear responsibility for promoting the preservation of its field&#39;s most important research materials, address the question of which library materials should have priority for digitization, and promote the creation of a register of library materials that have been or are being digitized. The report also contains appendices providing a bibliography of published preservation guidance, and a list of committee membership.</p>",

    "title": "Digital Imaging of Papyri: A Report to the Commission on Preservation and Access",
    "published": "1995-09-01",
    "description": "<p>The study of papyri has been significantly limited, and because of their fragile and fragmentary condition, papyri pose significant preservation and research challenges. This report explores the use of digitization to overcome these difficulties. The Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS) established a committee charged with studying imaging and other current technological developments and establishing standards for the field. An APIS contract with the Commission on Preservation and Access supported this study of the imaging component of the planned system that would answer the following questions: (1) Is electronic imaging now capable of serving as the main means of capturing the images of papyri and similar objects for research access and for preservation?; (2) What objectives must be met in such imaging?; (3) What technical standards should be established to accomplish those objectives and preserve the interchangeability and permanence of data?; (4) What are the limits of present technology, the controls and safeguards needed to ensure data quality and integrity, and the means of preventing obsolescence of the product? and (5) How well can currently available equipment satisfy the standards and objectives? This report relates the purpose and methods of the APIS study, defines archival and delivered images, discusses ways and means for capturing physical attributes of papyri and the preferred methods of capture, details technical standards and specifications, and ends with a brief discussion of quality control, migration, and refreshment issues. A list of participants in the Conference on Digital Imaging of Papyri (University of Michigan, March 3-5, 1994) is provided.</p>",

    "title": "Oversize Color Images Project, 1994-1995: A Report to the Commission on Preservation and Access",
    "published": "1995-08-01",
    "description": "<p>This report provides results of the first phase of a project to identify acceptable preservation and digital access techniques for dealing with oversize, color images associated with text. The goal of Phase I was to provide a preservation-quality photographic archival copy, a digital version for online access, and paper printouts. Five maps from brittle volumes were scanned, along with single-frame color microfiche of the maps, and 4&quot;x 5&quot; color transparencies. Printouts were made from many of the digital images. The report concentrates primarily on resolution and display issues relevant to modern printed maps, which consists of text superimposed on images made up of a relatively small range of colors without subtleties of shading. The report points out that image quality for both capture and display involves many factors that are not always easy to evaluate separately. They include: characteristics of the photographic intermediaries and how they were produced; scanning and display resolution; compression; storage; display hardware; display software; and network transmission limitations. It is concluded that evaluation of the digital files and the highest quality printouts shows that fine details can be captured successfully from paper original, microfiche, and transparency. For the purposes of creating an archival-quality storage medium combined with the potential for increasingly sophisticated electronic presentation of such materials, the project has been successful. However, at this time the ability to capture information outstrips capacity for easy access and display with average equipment. Therefore, the immediate online use of high resolution files is somewhat limited. Appendices include a description of vendor products, a chart of effective resolution (approximate), and the bibliographic record for the project.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The information in this report is condensed from the presentations and conversations, both formal and informal, that occurred during the 60th meeting of the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA). About 1,500 librarians attended, representing Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, and Colombia. Training for preservation administrators and preservation technicians was identified as a high priority need in Latin America. Because of the need for training, Latin American librarians were eager for current preservation literature. Maintenance and storage environments were also priority concerns; however, the breakdown of acidic papers was scarcely mentioned. Biological pests are perceived as a greater hazard in tropical environments. Of secondary priority, the conference participants recognized reformatting and bibliographic control, connectivity through new technologies, and opportunities for creative projects.</p>",

    "title": "Tutorial: Digital Resolution Requirements for Replacing Text-Based Material: Methods for Benchmarking Image Quality",
    "published": "1995-04-03",
    "description": "<p>This tutorial provides a means to estimate resolution requirements for the use of digital imaging technology in converting text-based material. It is suggested that benchmarks for resolution can be calculated by evaluating the physical attributes of source documents and by applying Quality Index formulas that have been derived from those established for preservation microfilming. The formulas are based on three variables: the height of the smallest significant character, the desired quality to be obtained in the reformatted version, and the resolution of the recording device. For the past several years, the Cornell University Department of Preservation and Conservation (New York) has experimented using the Digital Quality Index formula to predict resolution requirements for a wide range of documents using a number of scanning devices. The results of these and other experiments confirm the utility of the Digital Quality Index formula for bitonal (black and white) scanning, but a slight modification to the formula is recommended in cases where grayscale scanning is employed. It is cautioned that the use of these formulas are for benchmarking purposes only. Assessment methods for scanner performance are discussed, and a continuous quality assurance program is recommended. Sections include: &quot;Where to Begin&quot;; &quot;How To Determine Digital Image Quality&quot;; &quot;Scanning Methodologies and Compression Techniques&quot;; &quot;Bitonal Scanning&quot;; &quot;Grayscale Scanning&quot;; &quot;Verifying the Predicted Quality Index&quot;; &quot;Visual Inspection&quot;; &quot;Suggested Guidelines&quot; and &quot;Summary of Recommendations.&quot; Seven figures and three tables illustrate the process and data.

    "description": "<p>This report provides a review of Bulgaria&#39;s history as it relates to library collections, and describes the current state of preservation activities at key institutions. The discussion includes: the political history of Bulgaria and its library collections; the Soviet state and its aftermath; economic constraints; decentralization of Bulgaria&#39;s research libraries; and a description of and statistics for five specific key research libraries. It was discovered that although Bulgaria&#39;s government cannot make preservation a priority at this time, the libraries are free to initiate their own projects and collaborations. Bulgarian libraries suffer from inexperience in democracy, priority setting, management, and implementation, but are receptive to reorganization at all levels, and ready for reform, modernization, and leadership. The issue of decentralization and centralized library programs is complicated, but the past three years suggest that decentralization would be detrimental to progress and advancement. The most significant problems are: a lag in development of libraries and the profession; gaps and uneven levels of knowledge and expertise within the profession; nonexistent material resources; and lack of English-speaking librarians to absorb available information. Recommendations are made for the reintroduction of a national preservation program.</p>",

The commission&#39;s work includes: enriching American and international scholarship; encouraging and coordinating international cooperation in eliminating redundancy and wisely using financial resources; stimulating preservation activities in developed countries; and bringing preservation information to less developed countries. The first step of the program was to identify needs regarding preservation of and access to the world&#39;s written knowledge and how to meet these needs. Hundreds of institutions from dozens of countries have contacted the commission for information and guidance.

    "description": "The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) brings together experts from around the country and around the world and asks them to turn their intelligence to the problems that libraries, archives, and information organizations face as they integrate digital resources and services into their well established print-based environments. In 2001, the shape and form of the library in the digital age continued to be at the center of work by the CLIR. This document is the annual report (2000-2001) for the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR). It begins with acknowledgements, listing of staff and distinguished fellows, a letter from the CLIR Chairman, and a message from the CLIR President. Next, the programs are discussed, including: resources for scholarship; preservation awareness; digital libraries; economics of information; leadership; and international developments. Publications, advisory groups, and grants and contracts are then listed. Financial statements follow, including: independent auditors' report; statement of financial position; statement of activities and changes in net assets; statement of cash flows; notes to financial statements; and schedule of functional expenses.",

    "description": "The merger of the Commission on Preservation and Access and the Council on Library Resources (CLR) became official on May 30, 1997 when the Board approved the new enterprise, the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR). The CLIR statement of mission calls on the organization to identify the critical issues that affect the welfare and prospects of libraries and archives and the constituencies they serve, to convene individuals and organizations in the best position to engage these issues and respond the them, and to encourage institutions to work collaboratively to achieve and manage change. CLIR pursues its mission out of the conviction that information is a public good and of great social, intellectual, and cultural utility. The report lists funders and sponsors, and includes a message from the president. The four major CLIR programs are described: the Commission on Preservation and Access; Digital Libraries; the Economics of Information; and Leadership. CLIR will not maintain the kinds of grant programs that were a feature of the Council on Library Resources, or be open to unsolicited requests for project support. The report lists the publications that the two predecessor organizations issued in 1996-1997 and describes those that CLIR will issue. CLIR grant and contract recipients, project titles, dates the grants were authorized, and grant amounts are listed. Separate audited financial statements for the two predecessor organizations are provided.",

In this annual report, the Council assesses the environment in which it and the libraries it serves must operate as characterized by: (1) a switch to a service-based society, (2) an increased emphasis on accountability, (3) the changing demographic makeup of the United States, (4) increasing globalization of institutions, and (5) a troubled economy in the United States and worldwide. The annual report describes both completed and initiated programs in the Council's program areas (human resources, economics, infrastructure, access/processing) as it gives a picture of current activities. A special insert, \"Shaping a Foundation for the Future,\" by Robert Gurwitt, examines these unsettling times for libraries. The organization's financial report includes breakdowns for various projects.",

    "description": "<p>This review of Council on Library Resources (CLR) activities for 1989/90 begins by providing status reports on the four projects that have dominated staff efforts during the year. The report on the first project, on professional education, centers on the activities of the Advisory Committee on Library Education, which is concerned with ways to recruit excellent students to librarianship, establish effective interfaces between professional education and practice, articulate the content and scope of the core of professional education, and expand the influence of faculty research. The description of the second project, which focuses on bibliographic systems, highlights a report issued by the Bibliographic Services Study Committee called &quot;The National Coordinated Cataloging Program,&quot; produced as part of the committee&#39;s effort to stimulate consideration of policy and procedural changes designed to optimize cataloging production relative to costs. The description of the third project, an explanation of the relationship between information resources and scientific productivity, highlights the report, &quot;Communication in Support of Science and Engineering.&quot; Finally, the account given of the fourth project, a consideration of the future of academic research libraries, provides an overview of project activities, including the more than 30 grants that have been made to explore a wide range of topics and issues ranging from the structure of electronic text to the information needs of philosophers and the information-seeking behavior of a specific set of scientists. A statement from the Research Library Committee concludes the narrative report. Brief descriptions of 34 grants and contracts made in 1989/1990 for projects in research, access services, cataloging and bibliographic services, library collections, and preservation and librarianship are also provided, as well as lists of program committees and project participants; publications and reports resulting from CLR programs; program guidelines and grant application procedures; administrative notes; and financial information on projects active in fiscal 1990.</p>",

    "published": "1991-07-01",
    "description": "This annual report describes the activities of the Commission on Preservation and Access, a private, nonprofit organization that works through existing institutions and groups to foster, develop, and support collaboration among libraries and allied organizations in order to ensure the preservation of the published and documentary record in all formats, and to provide enhanced access to these records. The first of 12 sections, the introduction to this report highlights a multifaceted initiative undertaken by the preservation community under the leadership of the National Endowment for the Humanities' (NEH) Office of Preservation to preserve over three million brittle documents over a 20-year period. In the second section, a special report by the Technology Assessment Advisory Committee (TAAC) outlines the preparation of a series of analytic and conceptual papers that will explore options for reformatting preservation copy and the rapidly developing telecommunications technologies. The remaining sections focus on: (1) the organization, support, and 1989-90 initiatives of the Commission; (2) archival preservation; (3) preservation research; (4) librarian and archivist education; (5) the Brittle Books Program; (6) the selection-for-preservation process; (7) the International Project; (8) institutional programs; (9) the collaboration of the Commission with other preservation-related programs; and (10) the dissemination of information by the Commission to preservation audiences. Appended materials include a list of the Commission's reports and publications for the fiscal year; lists of the members of Commission committees, task forces, and the Board of Directors and staff; and the Commission's audited financial statements.",

    "published": "1990-07-01",
    "description": "This annual report describes the activities of the Commission on Preservation and Access, a private, nonprofit organization that works through existing institutions and groups to foster, develop, and support collaboration among libraries and allied organizations in order to ensure the preservation of the published and documentary record in all formats, and to provide enhanced access to these records. The first of 12 sections, the introduction to this report highlights a multifaceted initiative undertaken by the preservation community under the leadership of the National Endowment for the Humanities' (NEH) Office of Preservation to preserve over three million brittle documents over a 20-year period. In the second section, a special report by the Technology Assessment Advisory Committee (TAAC) outlines the preparation of a series of analytic and conceptual papers that will explore options for reformatting preservation copy and the rapidly developing telecommunications technologies. The remaining sections focus on: (1) the organization, support, and 1989-90 initiatives of the Commission; (2) archival preservation; (3) preservation research; (4) librarian and archivist education; (5) the Brittle Books Program; (6) the selection-for-preservation process; (7) the International Project; (8) institutional programs; (9) the collaboration of the Commission with other preservation-related programs; and (10) the dissemination of information by the Commission to preservation audiences. Appended materials include a list of the Commission's reports and publications for the fiscal year; lists of the members of Commission committees, task forces, and the Board of Directors and staff; and the Commission's audited financial statements.",

    "description": "<p>No resource is more important than the library in the preservation of man&#39;s culture and in his quest for knowledge. Yet in the 1950s -- when libraries were desperately struggling to deal with the problems that resulted from efforts to meet the needs of increasing numbers of patrons working in fields where recorded knowledge was growing at an exponential rate -- there was little outside help available to them. It is true that some foundation funds were being channeled into libraries, but these were generally earmarked for the erection of buildings and the improvement of collections and thus failed to attack major sources of difficulty. Confronted with rising costs, staff shortages, outdated buildings and procedures, libraries were falling far short of their own goals as well as the expectations of their users.</p>",

In the area of administration and management, the Council is continuing the long-range program designed to help libraries make maximum use of available resources. Since 1968 the Council has been engaged in programs devoted to attracting and keeping young people of high ability in the library profession by providing them with sufficient rewards. Some essential first steps are being taken toward the idealized situation in which all major libraries are linked providing one universal library to serve all readers. The limited funds available to the Council for the support of library automation activities will be given to only a few of the most promising projects. The Council has been concentrating its efforts in the microform arena on consulting services to libraries and related institutions and on the development of microform catalog applications. The problems of library material preservation has been a concern of the Council since its inception. The Council&#39;s concern with college library programs and international library affairs are also discussed. The report is ended with the financial statements.&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>In this report of the Council&#39;s fourteenth year, a sum of $1,722,375 was appropriated for the support of 29 new projects and work was continued or completed on a good many more. It has become increasingly evident that the average library will never be able to &quot;go it alone&quot; in some aspects of the new technology--automation, for example. The level of investment required to reap the benefits of the emerging national machine-readable data bases exemplified by MARC is far beyond the individual budgeting capacity of any but the very largest libraries. Agreement is growing that the only possible solution to the dilemma - especially for the medium-sized and small libraries - is for them to band together in local, state or regional consortia and thus pool their assets and efforts. This type of consortia is so expensive and complex as to preclude its development everywhere at once. The Council and other funding agencies should select the most promising of each of several types of development for a concentration of support. In this way uneconomical dispersion of limited available resources will be avoided.&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>This bibliography is printed on an experimental paper produced under a grant from the Council on Library Resources to the Virginia State Library, Richmond, .through the experimental work of W. 1. Barrow with the aid of trial runs made by the Herty Foundation, Savannah, Georgia. The purpose of the grant was to develop a paper suitable for use in library books, a paper which would ha.ve good characteristics of stability and endurance and yet be economically feasible. The paper used here is composed of well purified chemical wood fibers; one-third sulfate, one-third sulfite and one-third soda. It is filled with ten per cent clay and ten per cent calcium carbonate added in the beater. It is machine sized with Aquapel that has been developed by the Hercules Powder Company, and it is surface sized with a seven per cent starch solution. The first commercial run was made by the Standard Paper Manufacturing Company and was distributed by B. W. Wilson Paper Company, both of Richmond, Virginia. The paper has the following properties: basis weight - 60 lbs.,&middot; color - cream; opacity - 89; folds - 407 in weak direction (M.I.T. &yen;.I kg. tension); tear - 79 grams in weak direction (Elmendorf) and pH 9.0 (cold extraction). It is estimated that after artificial aging for 36 days at 100&deg; C, 40 per cent of the fold and 75 per cent of the tear will be retained, thus giving a theoretically useful life of at least 300 years</p>",

    "description": "<p>It is well documented that doctoral students in the humanities take longer to complete their programs and drop out at a higher rate than do students in the sciences and social sciences. In recent years, several large!scale projects have studied the issue, including the Council of Graduate Schools Ph.D. Completion Project (Council of Graduate Schools 2008), the Graduate Education Initiative funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (Ehrenberg et al., 2009), and the National Research Council Assessment of Research Doctoral Programs (NRC 2010). These studies are complemented by others: the National Science Foundation tracks the number of degrees awarded in its annual Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and produces other reports such as Time to Degree of U.S. Research Doctorate Recipients Report (Hoffer and Welch 2006).</p>",

    "description": "<p>The research library community has little strong or reliable data on the number of unique books in our collections and their &ldquo;rights&rdquo;&mdash;for example, whether they are in the public domain or in- copyright and, if in-copyright, whether they are orphan works. At its foundation, this problem is created by the dearth of reliable bibliographic information, or what I&rsquo;ve been calling bibliographic indeterminacy. For example, we&rsquo;d like to know how large the &ldquo;collective collection&rdquo; of all (or even just all North American) research libraries is, and how many unique volumes research libraries hold in aggregate; otherwise, there&rsquo;s no way to know the cost of digitizing or caring for these materials. We&rsquo;d also like to have a better handle on the question of what&rsquo;s in the public domain and, by extension, what&rsquo;s in copyright. We&rsquo;d like to know how many orphan works there are, or perhaps what proportion of the digitized content we have online is likely to be orphans. And while these questions and more are regularly part of the conversation around digital collection building, they&rsquo;re also relevant to more conventional library problems such as print storage and particularly shared print storage. We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in the collective collection.</p>",

By the close of that workshop, the outline of an ambitious multi-part study of undergraduates at the University of Connecticut had been drafted; it was formally launched in January 2010 as a four-part study called Assessment 360. The study&rsquo;s intent was to map where undergraduates were in terms of technology use, their academic study habits, and their use of space. With those positions, or coordinates, captured&mdash;if only fleetingly&mdash;the library could then assess its current position in relation to undergraduates&rsquo; habits, needs, and wishes in order to make immediate changes and outline future work.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In November 2009 Stanford University and the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) co-hosted an international gathering to discuss opportunities for collaboration in digital library research and development. The sixty-one participants, who represented thirteen countries and twenty-four institutions and included both senior administrators and senior technologists, came away energized and engaged to an extent that many found unexpected. &quot;I experienced...surprise at the articulation of our shared issues,&quot; said one. Others commented, &ldquo;I leave with a lot more work to do!&rdquo; &ldquo;I am overwhelmed -- thrilled with the outcomes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Interesting and exciting -- This dream might come true.&quot; These comments articulate a collective vision in response to the difficult decisions these leaders have been forced to make during the global financial crisis: in an era of retrenchment, they are seeking to extend the reach of their institutions through unprecedented integration of their digital collections with others&#39; in the international library community. This report strives to encapsulate the process that inspired such hope for the future, and begins to look at the next steps required to advance a broadly conceived effort toward greater cooperation.</p>",

As the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) stated in launching its Cataloging Hidden Special Collections and Archives Program, &ldquo;Libraries, archives, and cultural institutions hold millions of items that have never been adequately described. These items are all but unknown to, and unused by, the scholars those organizations aim to serve&rdquo; (2008). Reducing archival backlogs and exposing once-hidden collections will likely require that archives revamp their workflows, but software can play a role in making archives more efficient and their collections more visible.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Twenty-eight scholars in the digital humanities and representatives of the research and funding agencies met at a one-day workshop, hosted by CLIR in Washington, D.C., on November 28, 2007, to talk about the general problem of what can be done with the very large digital collections now taking shape as a result of mass digitization projects: the so-called &ldquo;million books&rdquo; problem. The workshop converges with CLIR&rsquo;s programs in digital scholarship, cyberinfrastructure, and preservation and is part of an extended, distributed conversation on these related topics that CLIR is supporting in several venues in 2007 and 2008. The November meeting was particularly important in that it included not only humanists, librarians, and computer scientists but also representatives of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the Library of Congress, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and Google, a list that illustrates the enlarged participation that digitization and computationally assisted research have created in the world of humanities scholarship.</p>\n\n<p>Although the discussion focused on text collections, we considered four major questions that are largely format independent but illuminate the implications of scale:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>What is the problem? How does access to large corpora of digital materials change that problem?</li>\n\t<li>What services do scholars need?</li>\n\t<li>How do we manage digital collections when the digital material is abundant rather than selective?</li>\n\t<li>What systems or infrastructure is necessary to provide services and materials to scholars?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The rich exchanges are captured in the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>workshop report, which identifies five major questions to inform the next phase of our distributed conversion on the future of digital scholarship in the humanities and makes recommendations for next steps.</p>",

    "title": "Measurement and Evaluation of Analog-to-Digital Converters Used in the Long-Term Preservation of Audio Recordings",
    "published": "2006-03-10",
    "description": "<p>The analog-to-digital (A/D) converter lies at the heart of the encoding side of a digital audio system, and is perhaps the most critical component in the entire signal chain. The A/D converter must discretely sample the analog signal, quantify the amplitude of the sample, and represent the measurement as a binary word. Whereas conversions made with the A/D converter&rsquo;s counterpart&mdash;the digital-to-analog (D/A) converter&mdash;can subsequently be improved for higher-fidelity playback, errors introduced by the A/D converter will accompany the audio signal throughout digital processing and storage and, ultimately, back into its analog state. Thus, the choice of the A/D converter irrevocably affects the fidelity of the resulting signal. For critical applications such as the long-term preservation of historic audio signals, to the greatest extent possible, the A/D converter must exhibit audio transparency&mdash;that is, it should neither add to nor subtract from the sound. To assess the degree of transparency, the converter&rsquo;s electrical measurements and subjective aural performance, as well as the converter&rsquo;s operating parameters such as sampling frequency and word length, must be considered. Finally, the signal-level input to the converter, converter-component design, and external conditions such as grounding and shielding can greatly affect the fidelity of the resulting file.</p>",

    "title": "DEI Efforts Across GLAM Organizations: A Report by the GLAM Diversity Subgroup of the DLF Committee for Equity and Inclusion",
    "published": "2023-08-31",
    "description": "<p>In early 2021, the Digital Library Federation Committee on Equity and Inclusion (DLF CEI) formed a subgroup to identify resources and activities that have been useful in supporting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts across organizations that fall under the umbrella of Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM), including within individual departments or functional areas. The Subgroup defines &ldquo;GLAM organizations&rdquo; as galleries, libraries, archives, and museums that are either independent entities or units within a parent institution such as a university or government agency. To that end, the Subgroup conducted an online survey in Spring 2022 to learn about DEI efforts that have been implemented or are underway at GLAM organizations. The Subgroup defines DEI activities as: Efforts to advance anti-racism, diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility across all of the organization&rsquo;s activities.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nThe Subgroup drafted a series of questions related to DEI-related topics at GLAM organizations and their larger institutions and created a Qualtrics survey distributed during the week of April 5, 2022 to various GLAM-related listservs and online forums, encouraging individuals employed &ldquo;at all levels&rdquo; in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums to complete it before it closed at the end of April 2022.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nThrough questions spanning three distinct survey components and generating both quantitative and qualitative data, respondents were asked about their work settings and their positions, DEI-related activities and topics being addressed at their GLAM organizations and larger institutions, and perceived administrative support for DEI initiatives at GLAMs and their larger institutions. 279 individuals initially responded to the survey, with 224 completing it.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nAnalysis of the survey data surfaced a set of significant findings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Engagement with DEI Activities: GLAMS and their parent organizations are perceived as engaging in a limited set of DEI activities, specifically &ldquo;Collection highlights&rdquo;, &ldquo;Public events or programs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Optional employee training/professional development.&rdquo; Attention to hiring and retention strategies were limited at both the GLAM and larger institution levels. While a GLAM&rsquo;s larger institution was reported as doing more DEI work overall and more likely than the GLAM itself to have an organization-wide DEI plan, GLAMs themselves were reported to be more engaged in addressing issues related to &ldquo;Accessibility, disability and ableism.&rdquo; The functional areas within GLAMs that received the most open-ended comments regarding DEI activities were &ldquo;Collection development&rdquo; and &ldquo;Metadata creation/management and cataloging,&rdquo; which we interpret to reflect a higher level of DEI related work in these areas as opposed to others.</li>\n\t<li>Sources of Funding for DEI Activities: The primary source of funding for DEI activities for all types of GLAMs was a general fund with administrative approval. Specifically allocated DEI funds were used most frequently by larger institutions, particularly academic ones, with fewer GLAMs using such monies.</li>\n\t<li>Decision-making Processes Regarding DEI Initiatives: DEI decision-making processes appear to remain in the hands of &ldquo;Administration&rdquo; for both GLAMS and their larger institutions, though a significant percentage of respondents did report the presence of a &ldquo;Committee, working group, or task force&rdquo; empowered to make DEI decisions, and a smaller percentage reported an individual enabled to make such decisions.</li>\n\t<li>Perspectives on DEI Initiatives: Perspectives on DEI initiatives vary by one&rsquo;s location in the hierarchy. Those respondents in leadership positions were more likely to report feeling that DEI communication was effective compared to those not in leadership positions. This, in turn, suggests that access to DEI related information is not widely shared.</li>\n\t<li>Leadership Support for DEI Initiatives: Our survey results reveal that leadership support of DEI initiatives differed by type of GLAM. Academic GLAM respondents perceived a much higher level of leadership support at their larger institutions compared with non-academic GLAM respondents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Analysis of the survey data has also led us to develop a set of recommendations to offer to the community:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Increased Transparency from Leadership: GLAM leadership should be more transparent about DEI initiatives and impact. Knowledge about the existence, realization, and outcomes of DEI work is not adequately shared, leading to significant gaps in awareness about such initiatives, which undercuts their ultimate goals.</li>\n\t<li>Expansion of DEI Efforts: DEI efforts need to go far beyond the three most commonly reported types of activities (&ldquo;Collection highlights&rdquo;, &ldquo;Public events or programs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Optional employee training/professional development&rdquo;) if they are to be transformative. For instance, more GLAMs and their larger institutions need to become invested in recruitment, hiring, and retention strategies and DEI perspectives and goals should be present in all functional areas.</li>\n\t<li>Assessment of DEI Efforts: GLAMs should revisit their DEI goals and review their current activities to assess if they are accomplishing desired outcomes. Some common criticisms of DEI programs in higher education and GLAMs are that they tend to be performative and mainly exist to increase the reputations of such organizations or institutions, or boost the careers of certain individuals, rather than to effect real change.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, given the rapidly changing political environment, it is important to temporally situate our project. Our survey was issued between the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and the related global demonstrations in 2020, and the current legislative backlash against DEI efforts in many states and locales in the United States, including within higher education. As such, the data and analysis reflect the activities and assessments of respondents before that backlash, during a time when the GLAM community was publicly committing to an increased focus on DEI.</p>",
